# Data-Science-Project---Sports-Celebrity-Image-Classifier
In this project, an image classification system was developed using machine learning techniques to identify celebrities' faces from images. The process involved several key steps:
1. Data Collection and Preprocessing: Images of various celebrities were collected and preprocessed to ensure uniformity and quality. OpenCV was used for image manipulation, including grayscale conversion and face and eye detection using Haar cascades.
2. Feature Engineering: Wavelet transformation was applied to the images to extract important features. This step allowed the model to capture both raw and high-frequency image information, enhancing classification accuracy.
3. Machine Learning Models: Different machine learning models were explored, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and Logistic Regression. These models were trained on the preprocessed image data to classify celebrities.
4. Hyperparameter Tuning: Grid search was employed to find the best hyperparameters for each model. This step improved the models' performance by optimizing their settings.
5.Evaluation and Visualization The trained models were evaluated using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score. Confusion matrices and heatmaps were created to visualize the models' performance.
6. Web Application: A web application was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a Flask server handling the backend. Users can upload images, and the trained model predicts the celebrity in the image.
7. Model Serialization: The best-performing model (Logistic Regression) was serialized using Joblib and saved as a `.pkl` file, allowing for easy deployment and reuse.
8. Website Integration: The machine learning model and class dictionary were integrated into the Flask web application, enabling real-time celebrity recognition from user-uploaded images.
This project showcases the process of building an end-to-end machine learning application for celebrity face recognition, including data collection, preprocessing, model training, web development, and deployment. Users can interact with the system through a user-friendly web interface, making it accessible and practical for various applications, such as social media tagging and celebrity identification.
